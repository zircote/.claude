## Getting Started

### Using Skills in Claude.ai

1. Click the skill icon (🧩) in your chat interface.
2. Add skills from the marketplace or upload custom skills.
3. Claude automatically activates relevant skills based on your task.

### Using Skills in Claude Code

1. Place the skill in `~/.config/claude-code/skills/`:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.config/claude-code/skills/
   cp -r skill-name ~/.config/claude-code/skills/
   ```

2. Verify skill metadata:
   ```bash
   head ~/.config/claude-code/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md
   ```

3. Start Claude Code:
   ```bash
   claude
   ```

4. The skill loads automatically and activates when relevant.

### Using Skills via API

Use the Claude Skills API to programmatically load and manage skills:

```python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key="your-api-key")

response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
    skills=["skill-id-here"],
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Your prompt"}]
)
```

See the [Skills API documentation](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/skills-guide) for details.
