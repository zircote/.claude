description: Create, manage, and cleanup git worktrees with Claude Code agents across all projects. USE THIS SKILL when user says "create worktree", "spin up worktrees", "new worktree for X", "worktree status", "cleanup worktrees", or wants parallel development branches. Handles worktree creation, dependency installation, validation, agent launching in Ghostty, and global registry management.
---

# Global Worktree Manager

Manage parallel development across ALL projects using git worktrees with Claude Code agents. Each worktree is an isolated copy of the repo on a different branch, stored centrally at `~/tmp/worktrees/`.

**IMPORTANT**: You (Claude) can perform ALL operations manually using standard tools (jq, git, bash). Scripts are helpers, not requirements. If a script fails, fall back to manual operations described in this document.

## When This Skill Activates

**Trigger phrases:**
- "spin up worktrees for X, Y, Z"
- "create 3 worktrees for features A, B, C"
- "new worktree for feature/auth"
- "what's the status of my worktrees?"
- "show all worktrees" / "show worktrees for this project"
- "clean up merged worktrees"
- "clean up the auth worktree"
- "launch agent in worktree X"

---

## File Locations

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `~/.claude/worktree-registry.json` | **Global registry** - tracks all worktrees across all projects |
| `~/.claude/skills/worktree-manager/config.json` | **Skill config** - terminal, shell, port range settings |
| `~/.claude/skills/worktree-manager/scripts/` | **Helper scripts** - optional, can do everything manually |
| `~/tmp/worktrees/` | **Worktree storage** - all worktrees live here |
| `.claude/worktree.json` (per-project) | **Project config** - optional custom settings |

---

## Core Concepts

### Centralized Worktree Storage
All worktrees live in `~/tmp/worktrees/<project-name>/<branch-slug>/`

```
~/tmp/worktrees/
├── obsidian-ai-agent/
│   ├── feature-auth/           # branch: feature/auth
│   ├── feature-payments/       # branch: feature/payments
│   └── fix-login-bug/          # branch: fix/login-bug
└── another-project/
    └── feature-dark-mode/
```

### Branch Slug Convention
Branch names are slugified for filesystem safety by replacing `/` with `-`:
- `feature/auth` → `feature-auth`
- `fix/login-bug` → `fix-login-bug`
- `feat/user-profile` → `feat-user-profile`

**Slugify manually:** `echo "feature/auth" | tr '/' '-'` → `feature-auth`

### Port Allocation Rules
- **Global pool**: 8100-8199 (100 ports total)
- **Per worktree**: 2 ports allocated (for API + frontend patterns)
- **Globally unique**: Ports are tracked globally to avoid conflicts across projects
- **Check before use**: Always verify port isn't in use by system: `lsof -i :<port>`

---

| `end` | number | Last port in pool (default: 8199) |
| `allocated` | number[] | Currently allocated ports |

### Manual Registry Operations

**Read entire registry:**
```bash
cat ~/.claude/worktree-registry.json | jq '.'
```

**List all worktrees:**
```bash
cat ~/.claude/worktree-registry.json | jq '.worktrees[]'
```

**List worktrees for specific project:**
```bash
cat ~/.claude/worktree-registry.json | jq '.worktrees[] | select(.project == "my-project")'
```

**Get allocated ports:**
```bash
cat ~/.claude/worktree-registry.json | jq '.portPool.allocated'
```

**Find worktree by branch (partial match):**
```bash
cat ~/.claude/worktree-registry.json | jq '.worktrees[] | select(.branch | contains("auth"))'
```

**Add worktree entry manually:**
```bash
TMP=$(mktemp)
jq '.worktrees += [{
  "id": "'$(uuidgen)'",
  "project": "my-project",
  "repoPath": "/path/to/repo",
  "branch": "feature/auth",
  "branchSlug": "feature-auth",
  "worktreePath": "/Users/me/tmp/worktrees/my-project/feature-auth",
  "ports": [8100, 8101],
  "createdAt": "'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'",
  "validatedAt": null,
  "agentLaunchedAt": null,
  "task": "My task",
  "prNumber": null,
  "status": "active"
}]' ~/.claude/worktree-registry.json > "$TMP" && mv "$TMP" ~/.claude/worktree-registry.json
```

**Add ports to allocated pool:**
```bash
TMP=$(mktemp)
jq '.portPool.allocated += [8100, 8101] | .portPool.allocated |= unique | .portPool.allocated |= sort_by(.)' \
  ~/.claude/worktree-registry.json > "$TMP" && mv "$TMP" ~/.claude/worktree-registry.json
```

**Remove worktree entry:**
```bash
TMP=$(mktemp)
jq 'del(.worktrees[] | select(.project == "my-project" and .branch == "feature/auth"))' \
  ~/.claude/worktree-registry.json > "$TMP" && mv "$TMP" ~/.claude/worktree-registry.json
```

**Release ports from pool:**
```bash
TMP=$(mktemp)
jq '.portPool.allocated = (.portPool.allocated | map(select(. != 8100 and . != 8101)))' \
  ~/.claude/worktree-registry.json > "$TMP" && mv "$TMP" ~/.claude/worktree-registry.json
```

**Initialize empty registry (if missing):**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude
cat > ~/.claude/worktree-registry.json << 'EOF'
{
  "worktrees": [],
  "portPool": {
    "start": 8100,
    "end": 8199,
    "allocated": []
  }
}
EOF
```

---

## Manual Port Allocation

If `scripts/allocate-ports.sh` fails, allocate ports manually:

**Step 1: Get currently allocated ports**
```bash
ALLOCATED=$(cat ~/.claude/worktree-registry.json | jq -r '.portPool.allocated[]' | sort -n)
echo "Currently allocated: $ALLOCATED"
```

**Step 2: Find first available port (not in allocated list AND not in use by system)**
```bash
for PORT in $(seq 8100 8199); do
  # Check if in registry
  if ! echo "$ALLOCATED" | grep -q "^${PORT}$"; then
    # Check if in use by system
    if ! lsof -i :"$PORT" &>/dev/null; then
      echo "Available: $PORT"
      break
    fi
  fi
done
```

**Step 3: Add to allocated pool**
```bash
TMP=$(mktemp)
jq '.portPool.allocated += [8100] | .portPool.allocated |= unique | .portPool.allocated |= sort_by(.)' \
  ~/.claude/worktree-registry.json > "$TMP" && mv "$TMP" ~/.claude/worktree-registry.json
```

## What You (Claude) Do vs What Scripts Do

| Task | Script Available | Manual Fallback |
|------|------------------|-----------------|
| Determine project name | No | Parse `git remote get-url origin` or `basename $(pwd)` |
| Detect package manager | No | Check for lockfiles (see Detection section) |
| Create git worktree | No | `git worktree add <path> -b <branch>` |
| Copy .agents/ directory | No | `cp -r .agents <worktree-path>/` |
| Install dependencies | No | Run detected install command |
| Validate (health check) | No | Start server, curl endpoint, stop server |
| Allocate ports | `scripts/allocate-ports.sh 2` | Manual (see above) |
| Register worktree | `scripts/register.sh` | Manual jq (see above) |
| Launch agent in terminal | `scripts/launch-agent.sh` | Manual (see below) |
| Show status | `scripts/status.sh` | `cat ~/.claude/worktree-registry.json \| jq ...` |
| Cleanup worktree | `scripts/cleanup.sh` | Manual (see Cleanup section) |

---

## Workflows

### 1. Create Multiple Worktrees with Agents

**User says:** "Spin up 3 worktrees for feature/auth, feature/payments, and fix/login-bug"

**You do (can parallelize with subagents):**

```
For EACH branch (can run in parallel):

1. SETUP
   a. Get project name:
      PROJECT=$(basename $(git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null | sed 's/\.git$//') 2>/dev/null || basename $(pwd))
   b. Get repo root:
      REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
   c. Slugify branch:
      BRANCH_SLUG=$(echo "feature/auth" | tr '/' '-')
   d. Determine worktree path:
      WORKTREE_PATH=~/tmp/worktrees/$PROJECT/$BRANCH_SLUG

2. ALLOCATE PORTS
   Option A (script): ~/.claude/skills/worktree-manager/scripts/allocate-ports.sh 2
   Option B (manual): Find 2 unused ports from 8100-8199, add to registry

3. CREATE WORKTREE
   mkdir -p ~/tmp/worktrees/$PROJECT
   git worktree add $WORKTREE_PATH -b $BRANCH
   # If branch exists already, omit -b flag

4. COPY UNCOMMITTED RESOURCES
   cp -r .agents $WORKTREE_PATH/ 2>/dev/null || true
   cp .env.example $WORKTREE_PATH/.env 2>/dev/null || true

5. INSTALL DEPENDENCIES
   cd $WORKTREE_PATH
   # Detect and run: npm install / uv sync / etc.

6. VALIDATE (start server, health check, stop)
   a. Start server with allocated port
   b. Wait and health check: curl -sf http://localhost:$PORT/health
   c. Stop server
   d. If FAILS: report error but continue with other worktrees

7. REGISTER IN GLOBAL REGISTRY
   Option A (script): ~/.claude/skills/worktree-manager/scripts/register.sh ...
   Option B (manual): Update ~/.claude/worktree-registry.json with jq

8. LAUNCH AGENT
   Option A (script): ~/.claude/skills/worktree-manager/scripts/launch-agent.sh $WORKTREE_PATH "task"
   Option B (manual): Open terminal manually, cd to path, run claude

AFTER ALL COMPLETE:
- Report summary table to user
- Note any failures with details
```

### 2. Check Status

**With script:**
```bash
~/.claude/skills/worktree-manager/scripts/status.sh
~/.claude/skills/worktree-manager/scripts/status.sh --project my-project
```

**Manual:**
```bash
# All worktrees
cat ~/.claude/worktree-registry.json | jq -r '.worktrees[] | "\(.project)\t\(.branch)\t\(.ports | join(","))\t\(.status)\t\(.task // "-")"'

# For current project
PROJECT=$(basename $(git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null | sed 's/\.git$//'))
cat ~/.claude/worktree-registry.json | jq -r ".worktrees[] | select(.project == \"$PROJECT\") | \"\(.branch)\t\(.ports | join(\",\"))\t\(.status)\""
```

### 3. Launch Agent Manually

If `launch-agent.sh` fails:

**For Ghostty:**
```bash
open -na "Ghostty.app" --args -e bash -c "cd '$WORKTREE_PATH' && claude --dangerously-skip-permissions"
```

**For iTerm2:**
```bash
osascript -e 'tell application "iTerm2" to create window with default profile' \
  -e 'tell application "iTerm2" to tell current session of current window to write text "cd '"$WORKTREE_PATH"' && claude"'
```

**For tmux:**
```bash
tmux new-session -d -s "wt-$PROJECT-$BRANCH_SLUG" -c "$WORKTREE_PATH" "bash -c 'claude --dangerously-skip-permissions'"
```

### 4. Cleanup Worktree

**With script:**
```bash
~/.claude/skills/worktree-manager/scripts/cleanup.sh my-project feature/auth --delete-branch
```

**Manual cleanup:**
```bash
# 1. Get worktree info from registry
ENTRY=$(cat ~/.claude/worktree-registry.json | jq '.worktrees[] | select(.project == "my-project" and .branch == "feature/auth")')
WORKTREE_PATH=$(echo "$ENTRY" | jq -r '.worktreePath')
PORTS=$(echo "$ENTRY" | jq -r '.ports[]')
REPO_PATH=$(echo "$ENTRY" | jq -r '.repoPath')

# 2. Kill processes on ports
for PORT in $PORTS; do
  lsof -ti:"$PORT" | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null || true
done

# 3. Remove worktree
cd "$REPO_PATH"
git worktree remove "$WORKTREE_PATH" --force 2>/dev/null || rm -rf "$WORKTREE_PATH"
git worktree prune

# 4. Remove from registry
TMP=$(mktemp)
jq 'del(.worktrees[] | select(.project == "my-project" and .branch == "feature/auth"))' \
  ~/.claude/worktree-registry.json > "$TMP" && mv "$TMP" ~/.claude/worktree-registry.json

# 5. Release ports
TMP=$(mktemp)
for PORT in $PORTS; do
  jq ".portPool.allocated = (.portPool.allocated | map(select(. != $PORT)))" \
    ~/.claude/worktree-registry.json > "$TMP" && mv "$TMP" ~/.claude/worktree-registry.json
done

# 6. Optionally delete branch
git branch -D feature/auth
git push origin --delete feature/auth
```

---

## Package Manager Detection

Detect by checking for lockfiles in priority order:

| File | Package Manager | Install Command |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| `bun.lockb` | bun | `bun install` |
| `pnpm-lock.yaml` | pnpm | `pnpm install` |
| `yarn.lock` | yarn | `yarn install` |
| `package-lock.json` | npm | `npm install` |
| `uv.lock` | uv | `uv sync` |
| `pyproject.toml` (no uv.lock) | uv | `uv sync` |
| `requirements.txt` | pip | `pip install -r requirements.txt` |
| `go.mod` | go | `go mod download` |
| `Cargo.toml` | cargo | `cargo build` |

**Detection logic:**
```bash
cd $WORKTREE_PATH
if [ -f "bun.lockb" ]; then bun install
elif [ -f "pnpm-lock.yaml" ]; then pnpm install
elif [ -f "yarn.lock" ]; then yarn install
elif [ -f "package-lock.json" ]; then npm install
elif [ -f "uv.lock" ]; then uv sync
elif [ -f "pyproject.toml" ]; then uv sync
elif [ -f "requirements.txt" ]; then pip install -r requirements.txt
elif [ -f "go.mod" ]; then go mod download
elif [ -f "Cargo.toml" ]; then cargo build
fi
```

---

## Dev Server Detection

Look for dev commands in this order:

1. **docker-compose.yml / compose.yml**: `docker-compose up -d` or `docker compose up -d`
2. **package.json scripts**: Look for `dev`, `start:dev`, `serve`
3. **Python with uvicorn**: `uv run uvicorn app.main:app --port $PORT`
4. **Python with Flask**: `flask run --port $PORT`
5. **Go**: `go run .`

**Port injection**: Most servers accept `PORT` env var or `--port` flag

---

## Project-Specific Config (Optional)

Projects can provide `.claude/worktree.json` for custom settings:

```json
{
  "ports": {
    "count": 2,
    "services": ["api", "frontend"]
  },
  "install": "uv sync && cd frontend && npm install",
  "validate": {
    "start": "docker-compose up -d",
    "healthCheck": "curl -sf http://localhost:{{PORT}}/health",
    "stop": "docker-compose down"
  },
  "copyDirs": [".agents", ".env.example", "data/fixtures"]
}
```

If this file exists, use its settings. Otherwise, auto-detect.

---

## Parallel Worktree Creation

When creating multiple worktrees, use subagents for parallelization:

```
User: "Spin up worktrees for feature/a, feature/b, feature/c"

You:
1. Allocate ports for ALL worktrees upfront (6 ports total)
2. Spawn 3 subagents, one per worktree
3. Each subagent:
   - Creates its worktree
   - Installs deps
   - Validates
   - Registers (with its pre-allocated ports)
   - Launches agent
4. Collect results from all subagents
5. Report unified summary with any failures noted
```

---

## Safety Guidelines

1. **Before cleanup**, check PR status:
   - PR merged → safe to clean everything
   - PR open → warn user, confirm before proceeding
   - No PR → warn about unsubmitted work

2. **Before deleting branches**, confirm if:
   - PR not merged
   - No PR exists
   - Worktree has uncommitted changes

3. **Port conflicts**: If port in use by non-worktree process, pick different port

4. **Orphaned worktrees**: If original repo deleted, mark as `orphaned` in status

5. **Max worktrees**: With 100-port pool and 2 ports each, max ~50 concurrent worktrees

---

## Script Reference

Scripts are in `~/.claude/skills/worktree-manager/scripts/`

### allocate-ports.sh
```bash
~/.claude/skills/worktree-manager/scripts/allocate-ports.sh <count>
# Returns: space-separated port numbers (e.g., "8100 8101")
# Automatically updates registry
```

### register.sh
```bash
~/.claude/skills/worktree-manager/scripts/register.sh \
  <project> <branch> <branch-slug> <worktree-path> <repo-path> <ports> [task]
# Example:
~/.claude/skills/worktree-manager/scripts/register.sh \
  "my-project" "feature/auth" "feature-auth" \
  "$HOME/tmp/worktrees/my-project/feature-auth" \
  "/path/to/repo" "8100,8101" "Implement OAuth"
```

### launch-agent.sh
```bash
~/.claude/skills/worktree-manager/scripts/launch-agent.sh <worktree-path> [task]
# Opens new terminal window (Ghostty by default) with Claude Code
```

### status.sh
```bash
~/.claude/skills/worktree-manager/scripts/status.sh [--project <name>]
# Shows all worktrees, or filtered by project
```

### cleanup.sh

## Common Issues

### "Worktree already exists"
```bash
git worktree list
git worktree remove <path> --force
git worktree prune
```

### "Branch already exists"
```bash
# Use existing branch (omit -b flag)
git worktree add <path> <branch>
```

### "Port already in use"
```bash
lsof -i :<port>
# Kill if stale, or pick different port
```

### Registry out of sync
```bash
# Compare registry to actual worktrees
cat ~/.claude/worktree-registry.json | jq '.worktrees[].worktreePath'
find ~/tmp/worktrees -maxdepth 2 -type d

# Remove orphaned entries or add missing ones
```

### Validation failed
1. Check stderr/logs for error message
2. Common issues: missing env vars, database not running, wrong port
3. Report to user with details
4. Continue with other worktrees
5. User can fix and re-validate manually

---

## Example Session

**User:** "Spin up 2 worktrees for feature/dark-mode and fix/login-bug"

**You:**
1. Detect project: `obsidian-ai-agent` (from git remote)
2. Detect package manager: `uv` (found uv.lock)
3. Allocate 4 ports: `~/.claude/skills/worktree-manager/scripts/allocate-ports.sh 4` → `8100 8101 8102 8103`
4. Create worktrees:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/tmp/worktrees/obsidian-ai-agent
   git worktree add ~/tmp/worktrees/obsidian-ai-agent/feature-dark-mode -b feature/dark-mode
   git worktree add ~/tmp/worktrees/obsidian-ai-agent/fix-login-bug -b fix/login-bug
   ```
5. Copy .agents/:
   ```bash
   cp -r .agents ~/tmp/worktrees/obsidian-ai-agent/feature-dark-mode/
   cp -r .agents ~/tmp/worktrees/obsidian-ai-agent/fix-login-bug/
   ```
6. Install deps in each worktree:
   ```bash
   (cd ~/tmp/worktrees/obsidian-ai-agent/feature-dark-mode && uv sync)
   (cd ~/tmp/worktrees/obsidian-ai-agent/fix-login-bug && uv sync)
   ```
7. Validate each (start server, health check, stop)
8. Register both worktrees in `~/.claude/worktree-registry.json`
9. Launch agents:
   ```bash
   ~/.claude/skills/worktree-manager/scripts/launch-agent.sh \
     ~/tmp/worktrees/obsidian-ai-agent/feature-dark-mode "Implement dark mode toggle"
   ~/.claude/skills/worktree-manager/scripts/launch-agent.sh \
     ~/tmp/worktrees/obsidian-ai-agent/fix-login-bug "Fix login redirect bug"
   ```
10. Report:
    ```
    Created 2 worktrees with agents:

    | Branch | Ports | Path | Task |
    |--------|-------|------|------|
    | feature/dark-mode | 8100, 8101 | ~/tmp/worktrees/.../feature-dark-mode | Implement dark mode |
    | fix/login-bug | 8102, 8103 | ~/tmp/worktrees/.../fix-login-bug | Fix login redirect |

    Both agents running in Ghostty windows.
    ```
