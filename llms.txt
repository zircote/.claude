- **Model**: Optimized for Claude Opus 4.5

## Core Files

### CLAUDE.md
Global instructions that modify Claude's behavior across all sessions:
- Planning confidence requirements (95%+ before proceeding)
- MCP query pagination patterns (token limits, batching)
- Memory agent usage guidelines
- API response validation rules
- Environment definitions (prod, cert, int, dev)

**`/git:cm`** - Stage all files and commit (no push)
- Reviews changes for sensitive data
- Generates conventional commit messages
- Splits new files vs changes into separate commits

**`/git:cp`** - Stage, commit, and push
- Same as cm but includes push to remote
- Follows conventional commit format (feat, fix, perf, etc.)

**`/git:pr`** - Create pull request
- Uses `gh` CLI to create PR
- Accepts target branch argument

**Architecture Planning (`/arch:`)**

**`/arch:p <project-idea>`** - Strategic project planner (Opus 4.5)
- Socratic requirements elicitation with clarifying questions
- Produces PRD, technical architecture, implementation plan
- Full artifact lifecycle management in docs/architecture/

**`/arch:s [project-id|--list|--expired]`** - Project status (Sonnet)
- List all active projects in portfolio
- Check status of specific project by ID
- Find expired plans, cleanup stale artifacts

**`/arch:c <project-path|project-id>`** - Project close-out (Sonnet)
- Archive completed projects to docs/architecture/completed/
- Generate retrospective document
- Update project registry

**Opus 4.5 Optimized Commands**

**`/explore <path|pattern|question>`** - Exhaustive codebase exploration
- Parallel subagents with "very thorough" thoroughness
- Anti-hallucination enforcement (must read files before claims)
- Structured deliverable with file inventory

```

### Command Definition (commands/*/*.md)
```yaml

---

[Detailed instructions for Claude to follow]
```

## Key Patterns

### Planning Confidence
Claude must reach 95%+ confidence before implementing plans. Ask clarifying questions until confident.

### MCP Query Pagination
```python
# Start with limit=20, estimate tokens
probe = tool_call(limit=5)
safe_limit = min(15000 / (estimate(probe) / 5), 50)
# Never exceed ~20k tokens per response
```

### Conventional Commits
- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `perf:` - Performance improvements (used for .claude/ markdown changes)
- `chore:` - Maintenance
- `refactor:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `ci:`, `build:`, `test:`

### Environment Definitions
Only four environments exist: `prod`, `cert`, `int`, `dev`

## What's Ignored (.gitignore)

Ephemeral/local data not tracked:
- `history.jsonl`, `todos/`, `plans/` - Session data
- `settings.local.json`, `.env` - Local config
- `plugins/` - Reinstallable from marketplace
- `projects/` - Project-specific data
- `*.json` - All JSON config files
- IDE directories, caches, bytecode

## Usage

1. Clone to `~/.claude/`
2. Claude Code auto-loads `CLAUDE.md` for global instructions
3. Use Task tool to invoke agents
4. Use Skill tool to invoke skills
5. Use `/git:cm`, `/git:cp`, `/git:pr` for Git workflows
6. Includes are loaded automatically based on detected environment

## Optional Files

- `.env.example` - Environment variable template
- `skills/.mcp.json.example` - MCP server configuration template
- `skills/CONTRIBUTING.md` - Skill contribution guidelines
